# Injuries of professional NBA players
## Background
In a 17 year overview, it was concluded there was no correlation between injury rate and any demographics between NBA players. Despite this, my instinct told me this was wrong because I believed taller players are more likely to be injured. The one injury that sparked this belief was Kristaps Porzingis' knee injury (torn ACL) because my initial thoughts were that he got hurt due to him being 7'3". This study can be used to determine the longevity of future NBA players, future negotiations between players, or likelihood of getting injured again. 
## Brainstorming
The beginning of the project started out as brainstorming the topic of my research project as I knew I wanted to research something related to NBA injuries but was unsure what exactly. I had to come up with all the potential quantitative and qualitative variables that I could possibly do research on. My initial list of variables was approximately 30 possible projects but I gradually narrowed down the topic choice based on what interested me and if there is enough data that exists to perform the research.

## Analysis

After all the data engineering, I ran a data analysis on my code using the language r as it is a strong language for statistical analysis. My mentor and online tutorials helped me with this part of the project since I had no experience coding in r prior to the project. The two statistical methods I conducted were a hypothesis test and a confidence interval. The hypothesis test and confidence interval showed statistical significance that there was in fact strong evidence to conclude that tall players are more prone to suffering knee injuries than short players.

## Conclusion
Although the 17 year overview found no correlation between injury rate and demographics of NBA players, my analysis concluded there was in fact a correlation between height and likelihood of suffering a knee injury.
