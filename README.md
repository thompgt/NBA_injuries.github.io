# Background
In the summer heading into my senior year of high school, I researched the correlation between height and knee injuries for NBA players between 2010-current day. I did this under the mentorship of a college student who has experience in the field of data science. The reason I chose a project relating to NBA injuries is watching sports is one of my passions and I was curious to see why taller players are the ones that are getting carried off the court/field in sporting events. 
# Brainstorming
The beginning of the project started out as brainstorming the topic of my research project as I knew I wanted to research something related to NBA injuries but was unsure what exactly. I had to come up with all the potential quantitative and qualitative variables that I could possibly do research on. My initial list of variables was approximately 30 possible projects but I gradually narrowed down the topic choice based on what interested me and if there is enough data that exists to perform the research.
# Data Engineering
After selecting my topic, I searched for datasets I would use from Kaggle to get data for the history of injuries between 2010-current day and all the NBA players that played in the timeframe. Then I did some data engineering which took the longest part of this project. This process required many hours of coding in python, lots of researching for functions I needed to use, and trial and error until my code was able to work. After all the coding, I made sure to comment on the code explaining what I did for each data cell. If you are interested in learning about the coding, feel free to check out my notebooks on the project.
# Analysis
After all the data engineering, I ran a data analysis on my code using the language r as it is a strong language for statistical analysis. My mentor and online tutorials helped me with this part of the project since I had no experience coding in r prior to the project. The two statistical methods I conducted were a hypothesis test and a confidence interval. Both methods showed statistical significance that there was in fact strong evidence to conclude that tall players are more prone to suffering knee injuries than short players. 
# Conclusion
After all the data I gathered and the statistical analysis tests I ran, I concluded that there was strong statistical significance between tall players and high likelihood of knee injuries.
